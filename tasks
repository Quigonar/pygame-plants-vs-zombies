Tasks


Randomize the rows the zombies are in

[2:54]  
Currenlly, zombies are made in game.py on the tick, but you can change it's rect.y inside zombie.py

[2:54]  
Add groupcollide to bullets/zombies

[2:55]  
Remove bullets when they go off the screen

[2:56]  
Add a new plan (gatlin gun is in the images folder), or make the repeater (double speed peashooter)



Notes:
-we had to change bullet stats from boolean to integer. Otherwise, once the bellsprout hits a zombie, it won't fire again until a new one is created in that row.
